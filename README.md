## Study: Developing an Agent-Based Model that Predicts Listeria spp. Transmission to Assess Listeria Control Strategies in Retail Stores
## Authors: YeonJin Jung, Chenhao Qian, Cecil Barnett-Neefs, Renata Ivanek, and Martin Wiedmann 

We developed an Agent-Based model that simulates the _Listeria_ transmission in the produce display section of the retail store.

### Retail\_ABM\_Data\_Analysis
This directory contains the RMD file where we conducted all the statiscial analysis using the output from our model on R.
* `Retail_ABM_Baseline_Result-table.csv`: output file that contains all the data that we collected as a result of our simulations from the model
* `Retail_ABM_Data_Analysis.RMD`: main file where all the statistical analyses were conducted

### Retail\_ABM\_Model\_Files
This directory contains all the necessary files that are needed for running our model using NetLogo.
* `Retail_ABM_Model.nlogo`: main model file for out agent-based model
* `Agents smarlist`: provides an overview of all the characteristics of agents, directed links, and undirected links used in the model
